# Connect Project

It is a project that I ( Ali Hussein ) made using ( laravel - breeze - inertia && vue with ssr routing ).

It has been designed & developed and deployed by me.

Connect is similar to facebook where you can login, post, like posts, and follow users but it focuses on time saving and productivity.
In Connect, You have your own profile or portfolio with your achievments that benifit the society.
You can post work or achievment like ( e-book - blog - course - article ). 
Also you can publish your photos to let people know more about you.
You can follow others and the powerfull of any profile is from the number of its followers.
And best works is the works with the top likes number.
It encourages people to benifit their society and helps others to save their time in a good manner.

You can visit my website to get all info about me.

Don't hesitate to contact me anytime.

If you downloaded the project don't forget ( making .env file with your custom config - composer install - npm install - npm run build -  php artisan migrate - php artisan storage:link ).
